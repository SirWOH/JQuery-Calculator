# Calculator App in Vanilla JS!
A simple Calculator app in Vanilla JS. I wanted to build this app to get a better understanding of JavaScript and to learn JS.

**Link to project:** http://kordellatimer.github.io/jQuery-Calculator

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I kept the HTML and CSS  simple. Two input tags for the user to pick two numbers to either add, subtract, divide, or multiply them using the four buttons. I put a click event on every button that will take the value from the input and perform a the action tied to the button. Then after the action is done, output the response in the span tag.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how effective jQuery could be. First with the methods that are tied with jQuery, and how simple the syntax is compared to Vanilla JavaScript. But to learn and understand JavaScript and his frameworks/libraries it is better to use Vanilla JS

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
